- Images in UI (Separate Batches with batch key being related to the image)
- Put all shaders into one big file to enable more code sharing?
- Add a slider widget to the UI (just to check that it is capable enough), probably needs Rect in Response
- Add Pbr Materials, Directional Lights, Point Lights, Shadow Maps?
- Submodules that get inserted at Runtime.
- remove msaa again and render ui on top of post processing.
- currently there are multiple ways to render text: unify them (e.g. instant geometry text vs. ui boards)
